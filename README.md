# SP OS

SP OS is a personal operating system project created out of curiosity and learning. I kept going step by step, diving deeper into low-level systems. I never imagined I'd build this much, but here it is!

## Features

- Memory management using segmentation
- Separation of kernel mode (ring 0) and user mode (ring 3)

## Build & Run

Currently tested with QEMU and Bochs.

## Why I Made This

This project started as a personal learning journey into operating systems.  
I focused on making things presentable early (like the GUI) to stay motivated, and kept exploring one piece at a time.
